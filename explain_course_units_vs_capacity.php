echo "==============================================\n\n";

echo "❌ COMMON MISCONCEPTION:\n";
echo "Total Units ≠ Maximum Students\n\n";

echo "✅ ACTUAL SYSTEM STRUCTURE:\n";
echo "==========================\n\n";

echo "1. COURSES Table (Academic Information):\n";
echo "   - course_code: 'STEM', 'ABM', 'HUMSS'\n";
echo "   - course_name: Full course name\n";
echo "   - total_units: Academic units/credits (e.g., 120 units)\n";
echo "   - duration_years: How long the course takes (e.g., 4 years)\n";
echo "   - is_active: Whether the course is available\n\n";

echo "2. CLASS_SECTIONS Table (Enrollment Management):\n";
echo "   - section_code: 'STEM-11A', 'ABM-12B'\n";
echo "   - course_id: Links to the course\n";
echo "   - max_students: Maximum students per section (e.g., 40, 500)\n";
echo "   - current_students: How many students are enrolled\n";
echo "   - year_level: Grade 11 or 12\n\n";

echo "🎯 HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS:\n";
echo "========================\n\n";

echo "Example: STEM Course\n";
echo "├── Course: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics\n";
echo "├── Total Units: 120 (academic credits)\n";
echo "├── Duration: 4 years\n";
echo "└── Sections:\n";
echo "    ├── STEM-11A: Max 40 students (Grade 11)\n";
echo "    ├── STEM-11B: Max 40 students (Grade 11)\n";
echo "    ├── STEM-12A: Max 40 students (Grade 12)\n";
echo "    └── STEM-12B: Max 40 students (Grade 12)\n\n";

echo "📊 STUDENT CAPACITY CALCULATION:\n";
echo "===============================\n\n";

echo "Total Students for STEM Course:\n";
echo "- Grade 11: 40 + 40 = 80 students\n";
echo "- Grade 12: 40 + 40 = 80 students\n";
echo "- Total: 160 students per academic year\n\n";

echo "🔧 CURRENT SYSTEM SETTINGS:\n";
echo "==========================\n\n";

echo "✅ Maximum students per section: 40 (can be increased to 500)\n";
echo "✅ Total units per course: 120 (academic requirement)\n";
echo "✅ Multiple sections per course: Yes\n";
echo "✅ Year level separation: Grade 11 and 12\n\n";

echo "💡 KEY POINTS:\n";
echo "=============\n\n";

echo "1. TOTAL UNITS = Academic requirement (how many credits to graduate)\n";
echo "2. MAX STUDENTS = Enrollment capacity (how many students per section)\n";
echo "3. One course can have multiple sections\n";
echo "4. Each section has its own student limit\n";
echo "5. Students enroll in SECTIONS, not just courses\n\n";

echo "🎯 SUMMARY:\n";
echo "===========\n\n";

echo "❌ Total Units (120) ≠ Max Students (40 per section)\n";
echo "✅ Total Units = Academic credits required\n";
echo "✅ Max Students = Enrollment capacity per section\n";
echo "✅ One course can have many sections\n";
echo "✅ Each section has its own student limit\n\n";

echo "🚀 Your system is correctly designed!\n";
echo "Total units are for academic planning, not enrollment limits.\n";
